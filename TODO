Phidias TODO

- put in the transition models informations already parsed and traslated to
  their effective datatypes: booleans to gbooleans, dates to GDates an so on.
  This will require many corrections here and there, both in PhidiasEngine
  and plugins...

- provide a non-modificable GtkTreeModel implementation to pass to
  ItemsViewer plugins, so to enforce usage of signal "item-update-required"

- permit to specify which predicates has to be loaded asyncronous, and use
  the GtkTreeModel as a cache

- use the same "extra_data" method for models passed to ChannelsViewers

- use libpeas and capuchin to manage plugins?
